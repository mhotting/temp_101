<- Vertex ----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Vertex class enables you to save Vertex geometrical entities.
A Vertex has 3D coordinates, a variable to manage homogeneous coordinates
and a specific Color, which is an iteration of the Color class.

To construct a Vertex you need to send an array with the following keys:
- '_x' for x coordinates;
- '_y' idem y;
- '_z' idem z;
- '_w' for homogeneous variable (optional, set to 1.0 if not given);
- '_color' for the color (I know you guessed this one...) (optional set to white)
All those attirbutes are private.

The following methods are available:
- Getters for all;
- Setters for all;
- doc method which displays the doc;

An attribute called "verbose" is a boolean, default set to False
By setting it to true you can display more info on the class mechanics.

NB: the control of the data types is up to you (except for the color)
