<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------

A class to manage your vectors.
You need to include the Vertex and the Color classes to make it work.

A vector is constructed using an array as argument:
- the key 'dest' of this array is a vertex, the "end" of the vector;
- the key 'orig' is the origine vertex (optional, defualt set to < 0, 0, 0>;

The following methods are available:
    - Returns the magnitude of the vector
        magnitude()
    - Returns a normalized copy of the vector
        normalize()
    - Returns a copy of the addition of this and the vector given as an argument
        add( Vector $rhs )
    - Returns a copy of the substraction of this and the vector given as an argument
        sub( Vector $rhs )
    - Returns a Vector which is the opposite
        opposite()
    - Returns the scalar product of this and the arg
        scalarProduct( $k )
    - Returns the scalar product of this and the arg vectore
        dotProduct( Vector $rhs )
    - Returns cos of angle between this and arg vector
        cos( Vector $rhs )
    - Returns the cross product of this and arg vector
        crossProduct( Vector $rhs )

The getters for x, y and z (axis magnitudes) are available.

An attribute called "verbose" is a boolean, default set to False
By setting it to true you can display more info on the class mechanics.

NB: the control of the data types is up to you (except for the origin Vertex)
